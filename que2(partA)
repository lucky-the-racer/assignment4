A. Create a VNet with Two Subnets
so for creating a virtual network i go on azure portal and then use these steps
1. Create a Resource Group:

• Go to the Azure portal.

• Navigate to "Resource groups" and click "Add."

• Enter the Resource Group name (e.g., "mygroup') and select a region (e.g., East US').

• Click "Review + Create" and then "Create."

2. Create the Virtual Network with Subnets:

• Go to "Virtual networks" and click "Add."

• Enter the VNet name (e.g., "myvnet:") and select the resource group 'mygroup.

• Under the "IP Addresses" tab, set it default as it .

• Under "Subnets," add two subnets:

• Subnet-1: Address range as it as

• Subnet-2: Address range as it as

• Click "Review + Create" and then "Create."

3.Now We  Create VMs in Subnet-1:

• For Linux VM:

• Go to azure portal and click on create a resource and then we choose "Virtual machines" and click "Add."

• now we Select the resource group "mygroup", and enter the VM name (e.g., mylinuxvm).

• now we Choose the region, and under "Image," select "Ubuntu LTS".

•We  Set the authentication type to SSH public key and configure the rest of the VM settings.

• Now Under the "Networking" tab, select the virtual network myvnet and subnet Subnet-1.

• Click "Review + Create" and then "Create."
  

• For Windows VM:

•We  Follow similar steps as above, but choose "Windows Server 2019 Datacenter as the image.

• Now We Set the authentication type to Password and enter the credentials like I'd and password.

• Under the "Networking" tab, select the virtual network "myvnet and subnet Subnet-1.

• Click "Review + Create" and then "Create."

4.Now We Create SQL Database in Subnet-2:

• So first Create SQL Server:

•Go to azure portal then create a resource and choose "SQL servers" and click "Add."

• Select the resource group 'mygroup', and enter the server name (e.g. "myservermy"), region, and admin login credentials.

• Click "Review + Create" and then "Create."

•For Creating SQL Database:

• Go to "SQL databases" and click "Add."

• Select the resource group "mygroup, and choose the SQL server "myservermy".

• Enter the database name (e.g., "mydatabase").

• Click "Review + Create" and then "Create."
